Before you start program (autoaccept.bat) you should change directory in bat file to autoaccept, 
you can press right click on mouse to file autoaccept.py and copy as path and paste it for a place "E:\python projects\autoaccept.py" with quotes preserved. 
you also need to replace the path to the image, just like in the bat file, only in the autoaccept.py itself,
 you can do this in notepad, also copy the path and instead of E:\python projects\Prynyat igru(tolko prinyat).png paste the copied path, after that you can use the bat file when starting the game search, the script itself will accept the game
